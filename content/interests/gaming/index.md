It goes without saying that someone with a carrer in video games probably likes games.

Admittedly I don't play many contemporary games as I once did. Most of current gaming interest are in retro games (or games with a retro vibe), and board games.


## Emulation and FPGA gaming

I have a small but growing collection of Linux "Chinese emulation handhelds", as well as two "Mister" FPGA gaming setups. I certainly prefer the authenticity of FPGA, but my unpopular opinion is I don't see much value in FPGA versions of most "3D GPU" game consoles (i.e. PlayStation 2+, GameCube+, Dreamcast, Xbox+). The reason is that development on these devices did not require low-lewel access to the hardware, or cycle accurate synchronizing with the CPU. Instead, games were written against APIs that mirror popular graphics APIs of today (OpenGL, Direct3D, Vulkan, etc).
