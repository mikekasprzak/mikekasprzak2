Founded in April of 2002, Ludum Dare is the largest online game
jam event in the world. The event attracts many thousands of
developers and challenges them to make a game from scratch in a
weekend. Find us at https://ldjam.com
Iâ€™m part of the team that founded the event. Originally a hobby project we ran
together, today I am the sole person responsible for the event. I handle
scheduling, running the event, managing the servers, custom software
development, and promotion of it and its social media accounts.

After growing far beyond expectation, and with our 15th anniversary on the
horizon, I put my my small business on hold to focus on building a brand new
event website for Ludum Dare. The new website is capable of scaling to support
thousands of concurrent users, and runs on low cost VPS servers.
Buzzwords: Developed a custom multi-user social network entirely from scratch
with a PHP and a MariaDB backend, transpiled ES6 JavaScript code for the
frontend (using Preact), a sophisticated compiler toolchain stapled together with
GNU Make, and a local virtual machine testing environment powered by Vagrant
and Virtualbox. Open Source.
