At 19 I was hired as a “Game Boy Programmer”, but I was
quickly promoted to a Senior Programmer thanks to my
homebrew Game Boy development experience. I established
our Handheld division, including the shared workflow and tool-
chains used by our teams for our projects.
Notable roles on released projects:


* The Emperor’s New Groove (Game Boy Color) -- Engine Programmer
* Hoyle Card Games (Game Boy Color) -- Lead Programmer
