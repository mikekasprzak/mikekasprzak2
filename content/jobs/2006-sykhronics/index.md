My small award winning independent game studio. I often worked alone and with
contractors, though for over a year it had 1 other employee. Sykhronics’ (sigh-
cron-icks) goal was to create original games for a variety of platforms, but I
occasionally did contract work for other companies. Sykhronics was put on hiatus
in 2015, but was eventually closed in 2017. I continue to sell software under my
own name.
Sykhronics Entertainment was a licensed Sony PSP, Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo
Wii U, Steam, Apple, and Android developer. Sykhronics also developed and
published software for Amazon Kindle, Symbian, Nokia Maemo, Palm webOS, Intel
AppUp, Intel MeeGo/Moblin, GameTree.TV, Microsoft Windows Mobile, Microsoft
Windows Phone, Blackberry, Tizen, Samsung Bada, Linux, and Microsoft Windows.
Notable Released Projects:
Smiles HD (or sometimes “Smiles”) - smileshd.com
Released for multiple platforms, most of which don’t exist
anymore (see list above). Winner of multiple awards. Finalist in
the Independent Games Festival Mobile in 2009.
