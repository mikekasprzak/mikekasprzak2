Every year, the [London Amateur Radio Club](https://www.larc.ca) (LARC) offers a 13 week course that teaches the material you must know to become a licensed amateur radio operator in Canada. LARC also administers the exams on behalf of [RAC](https://www.rac.ca/our-organization-3/) and the [government of Canada](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/licences-and-certificates/radio-authorizations/amateur-radio-operator-certification).

NOTE: The "basic" licenese in Canada is simliar to the "extra" or "level 3" license in the US, requiring a understanding of AC and DC electronics, in addition to radio related topics.

During the fall of 2020 I took the course, then the exam, scoring 96/100 and earning honors (80%+). Since then I've been a licensed amateur radio operater in Canada with callsign `VA3POV`.
