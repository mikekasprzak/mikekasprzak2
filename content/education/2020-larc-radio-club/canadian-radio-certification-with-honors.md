In December of 2020, I became a certified amateur radio operator in Canada.

As a certified operator, I'm able to broadcast on all amateur freqencies above 30 MHz with up to 250 watts of input power (DC). Because I received honours during my certification exam, I'm also able to broadcast on amateur frequencies below 30 MHz. See [RIC-3](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/licences-and-certificates/radiocom-information-circulars-ric/ric-3-information-amateur-radio-service) and [RBR-4](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/licences-and-certificates/regulations-reference-rbr/rbr-4-standards-operation-radio-stations-amateur-radio-service).

My callsign is [`VA3POV`](https://apc-cap.ic.gc.ca/pls/apc_anon/query_amat_cs$.startup) (victor alfa three, papa oscar victor). `VA3` is one of the Ontario prefixes,
and `POV` is an internet handle I ocassionally use (`PoV` specifically).
