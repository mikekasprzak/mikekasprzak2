Advent of Code is a programming competition that takes place December 1st to 25th. The event operates like an advent calender, revealing a new programming puzzle every day at midnight (UTC-5). Each puzzle has 2 parts, a "normal" and a "hard" part.

I decided to take-part as an excuse to practice using TypeScript and Deno. `*cough*`...I may heve done it for the free stickers too. For much of the same reason, I also set out to practice using Go by porting my solutions to the Go programming language after the fact.

With TypeScript/Deno I attempted and completed 20 of the 25 daily puzzles, but only completed 16 of the harder puzzles. With Go I only finished the first 2 days of ports.
